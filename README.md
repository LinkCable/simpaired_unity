## A drunk driving simulator in Unity

Made for CSE323 Human Computer Interactions at Stony Brook University, this is a "on-the-rails" drunk driving simulator game.
The aim of the game is to survive by dodging other vehicles on the road.

As you drive down the road your BAC slowly increases which reduces your reaction speed. With a slower reaction speed it makes it hard to dodge the traffic.
