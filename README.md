## A drunk driving simulator in Unity

Made for CSE323 Human Computer Interaction at Stony Brook University, this is a "on-the-rails" drunk driving simulator game.
The aim of the game is to survive by dodging other vehicles on the road.

As you drive down the road your BAC slowly increases which reduces your reaction speed. With a slower reaction speed it makes it hard to dodge the traffic.

Hopefully by trying this game the player realizes how dangerous drunk driving can be to you and to others.
